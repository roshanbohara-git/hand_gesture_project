# 🪨📄✂️ Rock Paper Scissors - TensorFlow Machine Learning Project

A deep learning project that trains a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to classify hand gestures for **Rock**, **Paper**, and **Scissors**.  
The model learns from images and can be used to play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer.

---

## 📌 Features
- Image classification using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.
- Custom CNN architecture for gesture recognition.
- Trains on the **Rock-Paper-Scissors dataset**.
- Supports evaluation, prediction, and visualization of results.
- Interactive prediction from uploaded images.
